Anki2Go is a lightweight client for reviewing anki decks. For the
moment, it is intended to run on the Maemo 5 platform with PyQt4
bindings and targets the Nokia N900 device.

It's based on the KTAnki prototype, which itself is based on ankimaemi
by Stefan Sayer and ankimini by Damien Elmes.

Installation:
Copy libanki into the top level directory of anki2go, before running
it:
$ cd anki2go/
$ git clone http://github.com/dae/libanki.git
$ ./anki2go

 Description  It is a vector graphic created in Inkscape. The elements are carefully
              aligned to pixels on a small scale so that it looks sharp at its native
              resolution.
